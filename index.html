                        <p class="art-sum">Gene editing is when a scientist makes a tiny, controlled change in the DNA
                            of a living organism. The simplest way to envision this process is to imagine editing a
                            giant manuscript. You flip through the hundreds of pages until you reach the once sentence
                            you wish to alter, and then carefully change a single word. This creates only a tiny change
                            in an enormously complex word document or, in this case, genome.

                            In this novel article, Japanese researches revealed that one of phosphorase, MARK4, should have mutated in AD brain, and phosphate tau protein to accumulate

                            are robust for brain imaging.
                            Both methods are not invasive but CT scan is less resolution than MRI, and MRI is more
                            expensive to use than CT-scan. Thus,
                            it has been crucial to link between these two modalities by artificial inteligent. Indeed,

The assay, which does not require the use of the live virus, was validated in two groups of patients who had COVID-19 from Singapore and Nanjing, China. It is much faster than conventional tests for neutralizing antibodies—taking only 1–2 hours to complete—and does not need to be performed in special biosafety laboratories.

                        <p class="art-sum">Extensive efforts are being made to develop culture systems that allow human skin to be grown in vitro. However, such systems generally fail to produce tissues of the same complexity as human skin, with the tissues usually being restricted to simple layers of epidermal and dermal cells. Here, the authors report the generation of skin organoids from human pluripotent stem cells, which when cultured for 4–5 months develop complex structures such as hair follicles, sebaceous glands and sensory neural circuits.</p>
